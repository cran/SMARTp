Description: Sample size calculation to detect dynamic treatment regime (DTR) effects based on change in clinical attachment level (CAL) outcomes from a non-surgical chronic periodontitis treatments study. The experiment is performed under a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design. The clustered tooth (sub-unit) level CAL outcomes are skewed, spatially-referenced, and non-randomly missing. The implemented algorithm is available in Xu et al. (2019+) <arXiv:1902.09386>.
