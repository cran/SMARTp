\description{
Sample size calculations to detect desired DTR effects, which includes (\eqn{i}) a single regime, (\eqn{ii}) difference between two regimes, and (\eqn{iii}) a specific regime is the best,
based on CAL changes under the proposed clustered, two-stage, SMART trial given type I and type II error rates
}
\details{
SampleSize_SMARTp computes the sample size required to detect the dynamic treatment regime (DTR)
(Murphy, 2005, \emph{Statistics in Medicine}) effects in a study comparing non-surgical treatments of chronic periodontitis, via the sequential multiple
assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, with two-stages.

Outcome measures (i.e. change in CAL) are continuous and clustered (i.e. tooth within a subjectâ€™s mouth,
where each subject/mouth is a cluster) with non-random missingness captured via a shared parameter setting, specified in
Reich and Bandyopadhyay (2010, \emph{Annals of Applied Statistics}). Each cluster sub-unit has a binary missingness indicator, which is
associated to its corresponding change of CAL through a joint model. The covariance structure within a cluster
is captured by the conditionally autoregressive (CAR) structure (Besag et al, 1991).

The DTR effect can be detected based on either a single treatment regime, or the difference between two
treatment regimes (with or without sharing initial treatments), or when one regime is considered the best among others. The mean and variance of the CAL change for
each DTR can be estimated by the inverse probability weighting method via method of moments.

Note that the first three inputs "mu", "st1" and "dtr" define the SMART design in term of matrices. From
Xu \emph{et al.} (2019+, Under Review), stage-1 includes two treatments, e.g., treatments "3" and "8". Participants who respond to the
stage-1 treatment will receive same treatment at stage-2, while non-responders will be randomly allocated to
other treatments, i.e. non-responders who received treatment "3" at stage-1 will be randomly allocated to
treatments "4"-"7" at stage-2, while non-responders receiving treatment "8" at stage-1 will be randomly
allocated to treatments "4"-"7" at stage-2.

There are 8 treatment regimes for this design. They are 1 (treatment "3" at stage-1 and treatment "3" at stage-
2 if responder, otherwise treatment "4"), 2 (treatment "3" at stage-1 and treatment "3" at stage-2 if responder,
otherwise treatment "5"), 3 (treatment "3" at stage-1 and treatment "3" at stage-2 if responder, otherwise
treatment "6"), 4 (treatment "3" at stage-1 and treatment "3" at stage-2 if responder, otherwise treatment "7"),
5 (treatment "8" at stage-1 and treatment "8" at stage-2 if responder, otherwise treatment "4"), 6 (treatment "8" at
stage-1 and treatment "8" at stage-2 if responder, otherwise treatment "5"), 7 (treatment "8" at stage-1 and
treatment "8" at stage-2 if responder, otherwise treatment "6") and 8 (treatment "8" at stage-1 and treatment
"8" at stage-2 if responder, otherwise treatment "7"). See Figure 2 in Xu \emph{et al.} (2019+, Under Review)
