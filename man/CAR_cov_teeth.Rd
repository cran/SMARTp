\title{The within-mouth covariance matrix with conditional autoregressive structure}
\usage{
CAR_cov_teeth(m, rho, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Maximum number of units in each cluster, i.e., 28 teeth in each mouth (the 4 third-molars are usually ignored)}

\item{rho}{Association parameter of the CAR model}

\item{tau}{Variation parameter of the CAR model}
}
\value{
The covariance matrix among the teeth in each mouth (assuming full dentition, i.e., 28 teeth) based on a CAR model.
}
\description{
The covariance matrix of individual teeth measures for each subject follows a Conditional Autoregressive model (CAR) density
}
\details{
\emph{CAR_cov_teeth} gives the covariance matrix among the teeth within each mouth based on the CAR structure
(Besag \emph{et al.}, 1991), given the maximum number of teeth for each subject (\eqn{m}), the variance (\eqn{\tau}), and the
association (\eqn{\rho}) parameters.

The CAR covariance matrix can be expressed as \eqn{\Sigma_{28\times 28} = \tau^2 (W - \rho D)^{-1}}, where \eqn{\tau^2 > 0}, and \eqn{\rho \in [0, 1]} are the
parameters that control the magnitude of variation and the degree of spatial association, respectively. For
matrix \eqn{D}, the element \eqn{D_{tt'}} is 1 if locations \eqn{t} and \eqn{t'} are adjacent and 0 otherwise. The matrix \eqn{W} is diagonal
with diagonal elements \eqn{W_{tt} = \sum_{t'} D_{tt'}}. Note, the argument \eqn{\tau} in \emph{CAR_cov_teeth} is the variance, and not the standard deviation.
